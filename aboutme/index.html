    <h2>Jeremy Oliver</h2>
    <h2>JP</h2>
    <p>My name is Jeremy, I'm 26 and I'm from Trinidad and Tobago and I recently reenrolled into BYUI to persue a BSc in Software Development. I love repairing and upgrading PCs that I buy for cheap, playing football(soccer), hiking and going for long drives mostly to the beach.</p>
    <p>I currently own my businss that sells car parts and accessories but I want to pivot to something that I can do while travelling etc hence the choice in choosing software development. I love BYU because it strongly encourages learning with the Spirit and also continues to teach on the importance of being lifelong learners.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church since I was 3yrs old, so basically all my life, my favourite scripture is Alma 37:37 because it reminds me of the importance of daily prayer. A quote I recently really liked was from this past April 2023 conference from President Nelson, "True disciples of Jesus Christ are peacemakers." </p>
