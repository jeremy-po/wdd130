        <p><strong>What is FSY?</strong></p>
        <p>The youth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints might&rsquo;ve already heard about FSY, if it&rsquo;s your first-time hearing about it or just want to know more, keep reading! FSY or For the Strength of Youth conference is usually a 5-day event that is geared towards helping the youth have fun and grow spiritually with other youth who share their same beliefs.</p>
        <p><strong>FSY Booklet</strong></p>
        <p>The FSY booklet was published by the church to guide youth to make the right choices, it covers topics such as dating, agency, dress and appearance, education, entertainment, media, family, friends, gratitude, honesty and integrity, language, music and dancing, physical and emotional health, repentance, Sabbath day observance, service, sexual purity, tithes and offerings, work and self-reliance. At FSY, you will learn more about these principles and how to apply them in your life.</p>
        <p><strong>What to Expect?</strong></p>
        <p>Here we will go through the journey we took to attend the Dominican Republic FSY conference is Bonao from Trinidad and Tobago in 2022. In this journey there were many firsts and many everlasting covenants and ordinances done as well as lessons learned that will last a lifetime.</p>

      <h3>The Experience</h3>
      <p>
        <p><strong>From TT to DOM</strong></p>
        <p>Embarking on the journey from Trinidad to the Dominican Republic to addend the FSY Conference took approximately 6 hours, it was an early morning flight, around 4am. It was a day of many firsts as many of the youth has never been on a plane before. The first flight from Trinidad to Panama was on a smaller plane, a Boeing 737-700. On arriving to Panama Tocumen International Airport, it was massive in comparison to Trinidad&rsquo;s. The second plane was much bigger, a Boeing 737 MAX 9, the biggest plane I&rsquo;ve been on, the youth got business class seats so they were quite happy with their &ldquo;lounge&rdquo; chairs up front.</p>
        <p><strong>Journey to Bonao</strong></p>
        <p>We then embarked on bus ride that lasted around 2 hours from the airport to Bonao up into the mountains. It was a beautiful place surrounded by trees, fresh air and birds. This is where we first saw the huts built with wooden walls, some with wooden floors also. These huts were previously built with thatched roofs but that has now been upgraded to metal roofs.</p>
        <p><strong>FSY Counsellor Agenda</strong></p>
        <p>As an FSY Counsellor, we paired in twos or threes. Out activities were slightly different from the youth as our activities began with an &lsquo;Assistant coordinator-counsellor meeting&rsquo; from 6:40am to 6:55am. We would then join in our delegated groups (called companies) with the youth consisting of around 15 youths per group to have an early morning participant devotional, after, we would join everyone else at the main hall for breakfast.</p>
        <p><strong>Devotionals</strong></p>
        <p>Devotionals were a core part of the daily routine, there would be an early morning devotional after breakfast at 9:30am by the session-directing couple. There the youth would be able to participate in the many spiritually thought lessons and gain a better understanding of what the Lord wants for them and how they can strengthen their faith in Him.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p>
        <p>Every night before bed the youth will write down in their journals things they learned, feelings they had and questions they may have, they would also take this time to set goals to accomplish. We as counsellors will meet with the youth on evenings for &ldquo;Reflect and Review&rdquo; where we ensure that they understand everything that took place that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Dance</strong></p>
        <p>One of the activities that the youth looked forward to the most was dance night. Some shy away while others took to the dance floor. This was a very different dance night as it was a melting pot of different cultures at this FSY conference which made it into an even more fun night to dance to Spanish and English songs.</p>
        <p><strong>Group Activities</strong></p>
        <p>Each group were in charge of coming up with their own cheers and banner designs, unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t find any pictures of the banners made at Bonao but I do have some from our FSY conference in Trinidad. The banner design and cheer choreography were judged by the crowd and whoever had the loudest reactions won the contests.</p>
        <p><strong>Missionary Service</strong></p>
        <p>One of the activities we had was missionary service day where the youth were taught by real missionaries what they do in their day to day lives and how they study to teach. After the youth learned how to teach, they were given time to prepare on a topic and teach their group in missionary pairs on the topic they prepared to teach.</p>
        <p><strong>Talent Show</strong></p>
        <p>The youth were given a few days&rsquo; notice that there would be a talent show night. Youth from various groups went on stage to dance, sing, play instruments or read poems.</p>

      <h3>The Temple</h3>
      <p>
        <p><strong>Santo Domingo Temple</strong></p>
        <p>After leaving Bonao, we all came to the Santo Domingo Temple. For many it was their first experience entering the temple (myself included). The youth were quite happy to be able to do saving ordinances for those from their families that didn&rsquo;t have the chance and the spirit was indeed felt that day. Here are a few pictures before and after we entered the temple.</p>
        <p><strong>Temple on a Sunday?</strong></p>
        <p>Usually, temples of the church aren&rsquo;t opened on a Sunday, however, the temple president made an exception this time because after we returned from Bonao it was already too late on the Saturday so instead, after Sacrament meeting in the morning we were able to enter the temple and we were basically the only people there which made it an even more memorable experience for the youth and counsellors on the trip. The spirit was felt, memories were made and testimonies grey stronger.</p>
