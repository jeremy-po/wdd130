                <h3>Santo Domingo Temple</h3>
                <p>
                    After leaving Bonao, we all came to the Santo Domingo Temple. For many it was their first experience entering the temple (myself included). The youth were quite happy to be able to do saving ordinances for those from their families that didn't have the chance and the spirit was indeed felt that day. Here are a few pictures before and after we entered the temple.

                <h3>Temple on a Sunday?</h3>
                <p>
                    Usually, temples of the church aren't opened on a Sunday, however, the temple president made an exception this time because after we returned from Bonao it was already too late on the Saturday so instead, after Sacrament meeting in the morning we were able to enter the temple and we were basically the only people there which made it an even more memorable experience for the youth and counsellors on the trip. The spirit was felt, memories were made and testimonies grey stronger.
