                <h3>From TT to DOM</h3>
                <p>
                    Embarking on the journey from Trinidad to the Dominican Republic to addend the FSY Conference took approximately 6 hours, it was an early morning flight, around 4am. It was a day of many firsts as many of the youth has never been on a plane before. The first flight from Trinidad to Panama was on a smaller plane, a Boeing 737-700. On arriving to Panama Tocumen International Airport, it was massive in comparison to Trinidad's. The second plane was much bigger, a Boeing 737 MAX 9, the biggest plane I've been on, the youth got business class seats so they were quite happy with their “lounge” chairs up front.

                <h3>Journey to Bonao</h3>
                <p>
                    We then embarked on bus ride that lasted around 2 hours from the airport to Bonao up into the mountains. It was a beautiful place surrounded by trees, fresh air and birds. This is where we first saw the huts built with wooden walls, some with wooden floors also. These huts were previously built with thatched roofs but that has now been upgraded to metal roofs.

                <h3>FSY Counsellor Agenda</h3>
                <p>
                    As an FSY Counsellor, we paired in twos or threes. Out activities were slightly different from the youth as our activities began with an 'Assistant coordinator-counsellor meeting' from 6:40am to 6:55am. We would then join in our delegated groups (called companies) with the youth consisting of around 15 youths per group to have an early morning participant devotional, after, we would join everyone else at the main hall for breakfast.

                </div>
                <h3>Devotionals</h3>
                <p>
                    Devotionals were a core part of the daily routine, there would be an early morning devotional after breakfast at 9:30am by the session-directing couple. There the youth would be able to participate in the many spiritually thought lessons and gain a better understanding of what the Lord wants for them and how they can strengthen their faith in Him.

                <h3>Personal Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Every night before bed the youth will write down in their journals things they learned, feelings they had and questions they may have, they would also take this time to set goals to accomplish. We as counsellors will meet with the youth on evenings for “Reflect and Review” where we ensure that they understand everything that took place that day.

                <h3>Dance</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the activities that the youth looked forward to the most was dance night. Some shy away while others took to the dance floor. This was a very different dance night as it was a melting pot of different cultures at this FSY conference which made it into an even more fun night to dance to Spanish and English songs.

                <h3>Group Activities</h3>
                <p>
                    Each group were in charge of coming up with their own cheers and banner designs, unfortunately I couldn't find any pictures of the banners made at Bonao but I do have some from our FSY conference in Trinidad. The banner design and cheer choreography were judged by the crowd and whoever had the loudest reactions won the contests.

                <h3>Missionary Service</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the activities we had was missionary service day where the youth were taught by real missionaries what they do in their day to day lives and how they study to teach. After the youth learned how to teach, they were given time to prepare on a topic and teach their group in missionary pairs on the topic they prepared to teach.

                <h3>Talent Show</h3>
                <p>
                    The youth were given a few days' notice that there would be a talent show night. Youth from various groups went on stage to dance, sing, play instruments or read poems.
